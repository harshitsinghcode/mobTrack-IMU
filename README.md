# mobTrack - IMU based Position Tracking ü§≥üèªüõú [ First of its kind ]

Explore the potential of your mobile device's IMU sensor + monocular camera with mobTrack. This repository hosts a comprehensive solution for accurate position tracking, enabling a wide range of applications in robotics, AR, VR, and beyond.

## Overview üìù

This repository provides a comprehensive system for IMU-based position tracking using accelerometer data from your mobile device. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Data Acquisition**: We capture accelerometer (in this case - `Ic4n607`) data from both Android and iOS devices with "Serializer Sensor" and "IMU-Utility" apps, respectively. Android data is converted to CSV format and stored in the `1. Accelerations` folder, while iOS data is converted from JSON to CSV and stored in the same folder.

2. **Calibration**: Calibration is essential for accurate tracking. Our system offers two calibration methods:
   1. Manual Calibration: Use a dedicated app to calibrate the IMU sensor manually.
   2. Script Calibration: Utilize our `calib.py` script to calibrate the sensor automatically. This script generates `calibration_coeffs.npy`, which contains calibration coefficients for further use.

3. **Data Collection**: Once calibrated, you can collect data using `mig.py`. This script retrieves calibrated data from the sensor and stores it in the `1. Accelerations` folder. Alternatively, if the sensor is already calibrated, you can use `sockets.py` to collect data directly.

4. **Data Processing**: The `sukhoi.py` script processes the collected accelerometer data. It filters the data using a band-pass filter with specified low and high cutoff frequencies. It then integrates the filtered acceleration data to obtain velocity and position information. Finally, it applies a high-pass filter to remove drifts.

5. **Visualization**: Our system offers visualization capabilities, including:

   a. Plotting position graphs for X, Y, and Z axes.
   
   b. Storing velocity data in `2. Velocities` folder.
   
   c. Storing position data in `3. Positions` folder.
   
   d. Interesting part of the repository is that, it also stores the frame captured at the moment with respect to imu recordings in `pics` folder, so that the imu data of every frame has been recorded which can be further used for varied applications.

## Getting Started üöÄ

- To use this system, follow these steps:

- Data Acquisition: Ensure you have the "Serializer Sensor" or "IMU-Utility" app installed on your Android or iOS device, respectively. Connect your device to the WebSocket server to start sending accelerometer data.

- Calibration: Choose the calibration method that suits your needs. For manual calibration, use a calibration app. For script calibration, run calib.py and follow the instructions. Use the generated calibration_coeffs.npy file for further calibration.

```shell
1. python runner.py
2. Enter 'c' to calibrate, 'd' to collect data with calib, 'dw' to collect data without calib, 'a' to run analysis, or 'q' to quit:
